    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      The Burek with Cheese is a widely loved savory pastry and a staple of
      Balkan cuisine. It is defined by its distinct texture: a soft, creamy
      interior encased in a wonderfully flaky, crisp crust.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its heart, the pastry consists of paper-thin dough (filo or
      hand-stretched vučeno testo) that is either layered or tightly coiled into
      a recognizable spiral (the "snail" shape). This dough is generously filled
      with a simple but rich mixture of soft white cheese, typically a blend of
      salty Feta and a milder cheese like cottage or ricotta, combined with
      eggs. The pie is then baked until it achieves a deep golden-brown colour.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to its hearty nature, <strong>Burek With Cheese</strong> is popular as
      a substantial breakfast, quick lunch, or comforting snack. The perfect
      bite offers a striking contrast: the fragile, delicate layers of the
      pastry shattering against the warm, slightly salty, and moist cheese
      filling. It is often enjoyed best when still hot, perhaps accompanied by a
      glass of plain yogurt or sour milk.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g Filo Pastry (Thin, ready-made pastry sheets)</li>
      <li>
        500 g Cheese (A mix of Feta and cottage/ricotta cheese works best)
      </li>
      <li>1 Egg</li>
      <li>Oil (or melted butter)</li>
      <li>A splash of Sparkling Water (or soda water)</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt (optional, depending on the cheese)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Filling Preparation & Assembly</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the filling: In a bowl, mix the cheese with the egg. Add a pinch
        of salt if your cheese mixture is bland.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the liquid: In a small cup, mix the oil (or melted butter) with
        a splash of sparkling water. This will be your coating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble: Lay out one sheet of filo pastry and lightly brush it with the
        oil/water mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Place a second sheet of pastry on top and also brush it lightly.</li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin line of the cheese filling along the long edge of the top
        sheet.
      </li>
      <li>Tightly roll the pastry into a long, thin tube (a "sausage").</li>
      <li>
        Coil the tube into a spiral shape (a "snail") and place it in a round
        baking pan that has been greased with oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling, extending the spiral until
        the pan is full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Before baking, pour any remaining oil/water mixture over the entire top
        of the burek.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Baking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bake in an oven preheated to 200 °C (390 °F) for about 30 to 40 minutes,
        or until the crust is golden brown and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>Let it cool for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
