    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      The Reform Cake (Reform Torta) is an elegant, traditional Serbian dessert
      celebrated for its luxurious, yet surprisingly light texture. The cake is
      defined by the contrast between its two main components: crisp, airy
      meringue layers made primarily from walnuts and egg whites (making them
      largely flourless), and a decadent, silky smooth chocolate cream based on
      cooked egg yolks.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cream is the star, prepared by cooking the yolks and sugar over steam
      (bain-marie) until perfectly thickened, then enriched with high-quality
      chocolate and whipped butter. This process results in an incredibly
      smooth, rich filling that melts instantly in the mouth. The cake is
      typically built with three or four alternating layers of the nutty crust
      and the rich cream, often finished with a final chocolate glaze. The
      Reform Cake is a symbol of celebrations and holidays due to its
      sophisticated, intense walnut and chocolate flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <h4>For the Crusts (Repeat 3 times for 3 layers)</h4>
      <li>4 Egg Whites</li>
      <li>4 tbsp Sugar</li>
      <li>4 tbsp Ground Walnuts</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Flour</li>

      <h4>For the Cream Filling</h4>
      <li>12 Egg Yolks</li>
      <li>150 g Sugar</li>
      <li>100 g Cooking Chocolate (min. 50% cocoa solids)</li>
      <li>200 g Butter (softened to room temperature)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Crusts (Repeat 3 times): Beat the egg whites until stiff
        peaks form, gradually adding the sugar until the meringue is firm and
        glossy. Gently fold in the ground walnuts and flour. Pour the mixture
        into a springform pan (20-22 cm) lined with parchment paper and bake at
        180 °C (350 °F) for about 15–20 minutes. Let the crusts cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the Cream: Combine the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and cook over
        a double boiler (bain-marie), stirring constantly. The cream is ready
        when it thickens significantly (about 15–20 minutes).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Chocolate: Remove the thickened cream from the heat and stir in the
        broken-up chocolate until it is completely melted and smooth. Let the
        cream cool down to room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish the Cream: Beat the softened butter until fluffy. Gradually add
        the cooled chocolate-yolk mixture, beating until you get a smooth, airy,
        and uniform cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble: Place one cooled crust on your serving plate. Spread one-third
        of the cream evenly over the crust. Top with the second crust and
        repeat. Finish with the third crust and cover the entire cake with the
        remaining cream or a chocolate glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill the cake thoroughly in the refrigerator (ideally overnight) to
        allow the crusts to soften and the cake to set completely.
      </li>
    </ol>
